# Express API Project

This project was made as a Week 17 project for Technigo bootcamp. The goal was to build our first API practicing data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering and limiting arrays and using Express. 

## The problem

This week was all about backend and I learned how to install and setup an Express server and create routes in Express. My API has severa RESTful endpoints which returns an array of books data, a single book by ID and an array of books that corresponds the request of filters via query parameters (popular books with query top=n amount, quick reads book and search filter with author/title query params). I also added pagination ('pages') using .slice() to return only a selection of results from the array.
Thanks to Heroku, it was quite easy to deploy this node project.
If I had more time, I would build documentation with Swagger, because I've done it with express-list-endpoints package.
